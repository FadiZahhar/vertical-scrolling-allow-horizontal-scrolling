# Explanation:
## HTML
The structure has vertical sections and a horizontal scroll wrapper containing horizontal sections.

## CSS: 
The .vertical-section is styled to take the full viewport height. 
The .horizontal-scroll-wrapper is styled to allow horizontal scrolling.

## JavaScript: 
It checks the scroll position. When the user scrolls to the horizontal section, it disables vertical scrolling and enables it again after passing the horizontal section.

## CSS Enhancements: 
The default scrollbar is hidden to give a cleaner look. You can optionally style a custom scrollbar. Smooth transitions (transition) and smooth scrolling (scroll-behavior) are added for a more animated effect.

## JavaScript: 
The wheel event listener is modified to scroll horizontally with a smooth animation. The scrolling speed can be adjusted by changing the multiplier for scrollAmount.

## Animation: 
The smooth transition in the CSS gives a slider-like feel when scrolling through the horizontal sections.
